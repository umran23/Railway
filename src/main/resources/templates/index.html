    <h2>Welcome to Russian Ultra-Speed Railway site!</h2>
    <p>
        RURS is an Russian Railway company. It has numbers of branches spread across the world. A person who wants to reserve a Train ticket must contact any of the nearest RUSR branch.<br>The RUSR manages trip operations manually, but as its customers grow in number, managing flight operations manually becomes difficult and time consuming. So, it would be better to use an automated system.
        <br>The Train Ticket Booking (TTB) provides a solution for online train ticket booking. It will have functionalities like schedule trips, search trip, book trip for customers, and verify trip ticket. The system should be convenient and user-friendly.
        <br>
